        <p class="description">
            The client, GlyphTech, wanted a page devoted to finding resellers, locations of stores that sold their products.
            I created a page with three filter options that allowed users to filter by the store type (online or in-person), 
            continent (labelled as Region), and finally, Country. The country filter was a dropdown populated with countries based on what the user
            selected from Region. If a user selected Europe, the Country dropdown filter would have all the countries in Europe as options to choose from.
            After each dropdown filter selection was made, the page would use ajax to populate itself with resellers that met the search criteria. 
            This made for a fast process as the user did not have to wait for the full page to reload or to fill out every option before getting results.
            Each store reseller was a content type with it's name (title), address, zip code, country, and url link. Additonally, I generated a country flag for 
            each and displayed it next to the reseller's information. I had an images folder for flags and had the naming convention for each one be it's country 
            code, and then flag.png after. Therefore, I was able to pull in any flag out of all 193 available country options and match it with the reseller based off
            it's country. This created an aesthetic and pleasing user experience.

            The client did decide they wanted to go for a different design after some time. While it is sad that my other original work is no longer available for display on their site, I have learned an important lesson as a developer and look forward to creating more fantastic pages for the client. The new presentation was easy to implement and maintains an nice aesthetic. Ideas change, and it's important as a dev to be able to shift gears and change with it!
